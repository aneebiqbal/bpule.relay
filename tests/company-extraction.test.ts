/**
 * Regression coverage for upstream company/entity extraction gaps found
 * during the Relay team bug bash while investigating "Create Lead does
 * nothing" (relay.bpulse.dev/prospect). Per explicit instruction: these
 * fixes broaden EXTRACTION, never weaken the downstream qualification gate
 * (hasKnownCompany) — a lead whose company genuinely cannot be established
 * should still be correctly blocked; these tests exist to prove the
 * extractor recognizes company names that ARE actually present in the
 * source, in phrasings beyond the original "Title at Company" pattern.
 *
 * Every new pattern here was verified against a battery of ordinary prose
 * to confirm it does NOT fabricate a company from generic text ("for Q3
 * this year", "at scale", "with Passion and dedication", etc.) — a company
 * must never be invented merely to make Save/Create Lead work.
