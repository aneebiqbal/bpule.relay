/**
 * Hardening regression fixture — Ved Kulkarni / Merget
 * (product-execution vs. service-buyer-intent regression).
 *
 * Ved is a founder actively BUILDING and VALIDATING his own product
 * (Merget): talking to founders/engineering leaders about their workflow,
 * describing customer discovery that validates the problem Merget solves,
 * pre-launch, inviting early access. This is PRODUCT EXECUTION and
 * VALIDATION evidence, not a signal that Merget needs external engineering
 * help or that Ved is currently buying software delivery.
 *
 * Root-caused failures:
 * 1. classifyBusinessModel had no PRODUCT_MODEL_PATTERNS match for "we're
 *    building [long descriptive phrase] infrastructure" (only recognized
 *    "product/platform/app/SaaS/service/tool/solution", not
 *    "infrastructure", and required the noun immediately after the verb
 *    with no gap for descriptive words in between) — so Ved's own-product
 *    description was invisible to classification, leaving businessModel
 *    UNKNOWN and relationship defaulting to POTENTIAL_BUYER.
 * 2. Even once PRODUCT was detected, deriveRelationship only recognized
 *    BD/partnership-outreach language (OWN_PRODUCT_SALES_BD_PATTERNS) as
 *    evidence of "founder selling own product, not buying delivery" — it
 *    had no pattern family for the pre-launch/customer-discovery/
 *    validation stage, which is an equally common and equally non-buyer
 *    founder activity.
 * 3. The NOT_APPLICABLE remote-eligibility override spread the pre-override
 *    workplaceType/remoteScope/evidence fields through instead of resetting
 *    them, so a fabricated "explicit ask for external project help"
 *    evidence string (pattern-matched on generic engineering vocabulary)
 *    survived into the canonical result even though eligibility correctly
 *    read NOT_APPLICABLE — exactly the kind of stale non-semantic metadata
 *    that must never reach strategy/message grounding.
 * 4. decideContact's non-buyer "has genuine identity or activity" gate
 *    required BOTH (name or title) AND a successfully-parsed company name,
 *    so a real, clearly-identified person (name + title) whose company
 *    failed to parse out of an unusual title format ("Founder & CEO ·
 *    Merget") fell through to a manufactured SKIP/"not a credible contact"
 *    result — overcorrecting exactly the failure mode the user explicitly
 *    warned against.
 *
 * DO NOT special-case "Ved", "Kulkarni", "Merget", or any wording from this
 * profile anywhere in application code, and do not tune his numeric score.
 * Fixes derived from this fixture must be general semantic fixes (product-
 * model pattern coverage, pre-launch/validation relationship classification,
 * full eligibility-object reset on override, identity-signal robustness to
 * partial extraction), verified by running this fixture, not fixes that
 * pattern-match this text.
