/**
 * Intelligence Input Hash — stable reuse boundary
 *
 * Relay hardening sprint, Phase 6.
 *
 * Problem this solves: produceCanonicalIntelligence() was invoked fresh on
 * every request with no memory of prior runs. Re-pasting the exact same
 * source text (a retry, re-opening the same profile days later, a duplicate
 * request) always re-ran the full LLM extraction pipeline, fully exposed to
 * provider/model/sampling variance — violating "same canonical evidence +
 * same versions = same canonical intelligence."
 *
 * This module computes a deterministic hash of what legitimately affects the
 * canonical result. Two calls with the same hash (and matching pipeline/score
 * versions) should produce the identical canonical intelligence — so the
 * second call can reuse the first's persisted result instead of invoking AI
 * again.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — what does NOT go in the hash:
 * - Timestamps, run IDs, request IDs — these are metadata about a run, not
 *   inputs to it, and including them would make every hash unique (defeating
 *   the whole point).
 * - UI state (which tab is open, selected profile in the UI, etc.) unless it
 *   is actually passed into the scoring input (see below).
 *
 * What DOES go in the hash today:
 * - Normalized source text (see normalizeForHash — conservative whitespace
 *   normalization only; this is NOT semantic evidence canonicalization,
 *   which is a separate, harder problem (Phase 5) that this module does not
 *   attempt. Wording changes that alter meaning correctly produce a
 *   different hash and a fresh extraction.)
 * - The intelligence pipeline version (extraction + normalization + prompts
 *   bundled as one version today — see INTELLIGENCE_PIPELINE_VERSION below;
 *   split into separate extraction/normalization/prompt versions later if
 *   they ever need to change independently of each other).
 * - The scoring version (SCORE_VERSION from scoring-engine.ts).
 *
 * What SHOULD go in the hash but doesn't yet, because it doesn't yet
 * legitimately affect the score: organization config and Revenue Identity
 * context. As of this sprint, OrchestratorOptions like hasCredibleIdentity /
 * hasRelevantProof are never actually passed by any call site — they're
 * always inferred from the extracted content itself (see orchestrator.ts's
 * infer* functions), so they're not independent inputs yet. If/when a real
 * org-config or Revenue-Identity-dependent input is wired in, it MUST be
 * added to buildIntelligenceInputHash's parameters and folded into the hash,
 * or reuse will silently ignore a real source of variance.
