/**
 * Drop buyer-opportunity signals that are not backed by buyer-directional

 * conversation timing stay on the commercial reading and must not become
 * buying intent.
 *
 * Three independent rules, not one blanket strip:
 * 1. BUYER_ONLY_SIGNALS (explicit_ask/freelance_project_need/
 *    technical_problem/hiring/hiring_pressure) require buyer-directional
 *    evidence (a BUYER_PATTERNS match) — without it they are deleted.
 * 2. growth_signal ALWAYS requires its own typed COMPANY_GROWTH evidence
 *    (headcount/revenue/customer/funding growth), independent of buyer
 *    evidence — an ambitious company description, global-market language,
 *    or founder/technical activity is never growth evidence on its own
 *    (see Mansur/XHYRE, Andrew/Orthoboost).
 * 3. RELEVANT_CHANGE_SIGNALS (launch/migration/rebuild) are a distinct,
 *    legitimate "worth a low-pressure connect, not a pitch" reason in their
 *    own right (see decideContact's RELEVANT_CHANGE branch) and are NEVER
 *    stripped by the buyer-evidence check — they were never buyer claims to
 *    begin with, so the absence of buyer evidence says nothing about them.
